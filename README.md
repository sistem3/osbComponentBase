# osbComponentBase

Angular JS (2.0) Component Library Base is an extension of [jhades awesome library example] (https://github.com/jhades/angular2-library-example) and just adds a few bells and whistles, such as SASS workflow and some new NPM scripts. I will be adding to this further by adding Jasmine/Karma tests as well as better documentation.

# Installation
Clone the repository and do:
`npm install`
Build the component via:
`npm run build`
To test component locally:
- `cd sandbox`
- `npm install`
- `npm run build`
- `npm start`
