Angular JS (2.0) Component library base

Angular JS (2.0) Component Library is an extenstion of [jhades awesome library example] (https://github.com/jhades/angular2-library-example) and just adds a few bells and whisltes, such as SASS workflow and some new NPM scripts. I will be adding to this further by adding Jasmine/Karma tests as well as better documentation.
